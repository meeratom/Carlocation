# Carlocation
This android project lets the user save a geographic location. 
The user can later see the saved position on map along with his current location (this feature uses google maps andriod API V2).
The user can also get the directions from his current location to the earlier marked location.
The saved location will be lost only when the app exits (not on just closing the app screen).

This was developed using android studio.
